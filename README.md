### **AI**-Driven Engineering Philosophy

My approach to software engineering is rooted in an **AI-first mindset**. I believe that modern development is most effective when human expertise is augmented by a powerful, integrated **AI toolchain**. This philosophy is not about replacing fundamental skills but amplifying them. By leveraging **AI** for everything from architectural brainstorming and code generation to advanced debugging and workflow automation, I can build more robust, sophisticated, and production-ready systems in a fraction of the time.

This methodology allows me to focus on high-level problem-solving and creative solutions, while **AI** handles the routine, boilerplate, and often time-consuming aspects of development. The result is a hyper-efficient workflow that produces high-quality, maintainable, and innovative software.

### **AI** Toolchain & Infrastructure

-   **Core **AI** Assistants:**
    -   **Gemini & Claude:** For advanced reasoning, architectural design, and complex code generation.
    -   **Copilot & Cursor:** For intelligent, real-time code completion and **AI-native** editing.
    -   **Jules & Perplexity:** For specialized coding tasks, research, and exploring novel solutions.
-   **Supporting Infrastructure:**
    -   A dedicated cluster of **13 MCP servers** for development, testing, and deployment:
        -   **Docker**
        -   **Supabase**
        -   **Github**
        -   **Context7**
        -   **Perplexity**
        -   **Time**
        -   **Cloudflare**
        -   **Filesystem**
        -   **Memory**
        -   **Zapier**
        -   **Google Workspace**
        -   **Sequential Thinking**
        -   **BrowserMCP**

### Professional Summary

**AI-driven** Software Engineer with deep expertise in C++20, competitive programming, and full-stack development. My core competency lies in architecting and implementing sophisticated, production-ready systems by leveraging a powerful, integrated **AI toolchain**. I specialize in creating automated, hyper-efficient workflows that enhance code quality, accelerate development, and drive innovation.

### Personal Statement

I am a software engineer who thrives at the intersection of advanced algorithms, full-stack development, and cutting-edge **AI-driven engineering**. My passion lies in building complex, high-impact solutions, and my methodology is defined by a deep integration of **AI** tools throughout the entire development lifecycle.

My work on **Bookify**, a production-ready event booking platform, is a testament to this philosophy. I architected and built this application from the ground up using React, TypeScript, and Supabase, with **Gemini** and **Claude** as my constant collaborators for architectural design, code generation, and debugging. This project, which led to a commercial opportunity, showcases my ability to deliver high-quality, enterprise-grade software in a hyper-efficient, **AI-first** manner.

This same **AI-augmented** approach is evident in my other projects, such as the **Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe Game**. Here, I applied a modern frontend stack—React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS—to a classic problem, focusing on a clean, responsive UI and a modular codebase. The game's logic is encapsulated in a custom React Hook (`useTicTacToe`), demonstrating my commitment to writing maintainable, well-structured code, a process significantly streamlined by my **AI toolchain**.

I am constantly seeking opportunities to push the boundaries of what's possible with an **AI-augmented workflow**. My unique blend of full-stack expertise, deep algorithmic knowledge, and a state-of-the-art **AI toolchain** allows me to tackle complex challenges with creativity and efficiency.
