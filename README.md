### Professional Summary

**AI-focused Software Engineer** with advanced C++20 expertise and an extensive
competitive programming background. Demonstrated mastery in algorithmic
problem-solving and production-ready full-stack development, with a
specialization in architecting sophisticated systems and automated toolchains
through heavily leveraged **AI-assisted** workflows. My approach is centered on
using a powerful **AI toolchain** to enhance productivity, code quality, and
innovation across the entire development lifecycle.

### Personal Statement

I am a passionate software engineer who thrives at the intersection of advanced
algorithmic problem-solving, practical application development, and cutting-edge
**AI-driven** engineering. My journey in technology is driven by an insatiable
curiosity to understand complex systems and a desire to build solutions that
make a meaningful impact, augmented by a powerful suite of **AI tools**.

My recent work on **Bookify**, a production-ready event booking platform, best
exemplifies my commitment to this philosophy. I architected and built this
full-stack application from the ground up using React, TypeScript, and Supabase,
leveraging **AI assistants** like **Gemini** and **Claude** for architectural
brainstorming, code generation, and advanced debugging. This project, which
resulted in a commercial opportunity, demonstrates my ability to translate
complex requirements into tangible, high-quality software and showcases my
expertise in modern web technologies—from database design with Row Level
Security to responsive UI development, all accelerated through an **AI-first**
workflow.

The methodical, performance-oriented mindset required for such a project is
rooted in my extensive competitive programming background. While I have deep
expertise in modern C++, I see it as the foundation that enables me to excel
across the entire stack. This versatility is reflected in other projects, from
my **Universal C++20 Competitive Programming Template**, which highlights my
skills in systems thinking and automation—a project whose development was
significantly enhanced by **AI** for exploring novel algorithmic approaches and
ensuring best practices—to my **Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe Game**, where I applied
a modern React and TypeScript stack to a classic problem, focusing on a clean
UI and maintainable code.

I am constantly learning and evolving, and I am excited by opportunities to
contribute to innovative projects where I can leverage my unique blend of
full-stack development expertise, grounded in a deep understanding of
high-performance algorithms and systems, and amplified by my proficiency with a
state-of-the-art **AI toolchain**.
